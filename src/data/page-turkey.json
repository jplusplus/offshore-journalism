  "html": "<h2>Cumhuriyet</h2><p>What happens if a government doesn’t want to spread certain news items in the age of the Internet? As concerns about national security and terror attacks increase, so do the legal and judicial tools to monitor and censor media outlets.</p><p>Turkey was always notorious with media crackdowns and governmental pressure on journalists. In Reporters Without Border’s 2016 World Press Freedom Index, Turkey is ranked 151st out of 180 and, according to the Twitter Transparency Report released in March 2017, Turkey issues the largest number of censorship requests by court order.<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt1\" id=\"ftnt_ref1\">[1]</a></sup> Keep in mind that studies showed that Twitter under-reports censored tweets in Turkey and warned that similar trends might hold for other countries.<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt2\" id=\"ftnt_ref2\">[2]</a></sup></p><p>In this framework, discourses of national defense and public security provide a safe haven for the government to practice and legitimize censorship through judicial injunctions. The rise in number of court orders goes hand in hand with the increase in deadly attacks.</p><p>Nevertheless, one of the most serious crackdowns has been on the daily <em>Cumhuriyet</em>’s writers and staff, following their famous “Turkish Intelligence Agency (MIT) truck” article. In 2015, editor-in-chief Can Dündar and Ankara bureau chief Erdem Gül have been charged with life imprisonment after the newspaper shared a video showing a transport of weapons to Syria, thereby offering proof of the Turkish government’s support to the Islamic State. <em>Cumhuriyet</em> is one of the oldest Turkish newspapers and it has been renowned for its opposition towards government. However, with charges of revealing confidential information and being members of terrorist organization, many of the newspaper’s staff including reporters, columnists and executives are currently in prison; the editor managed to find refuge in Germany, after months in jail.<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt3\" id=\"ftnt_ref3\">[3]</a></sup></p><h2>What was the article about</h2><p>In January 2014, the local prosecutor requested the Gendarmerie in the Southeastern city of Adana to stop and search lorries thought to be carrying weapons to jihadist groups to Syria, at a border crossing point controlled by ISIS (Bab al-Hawa). The government claimed that the trucks were sending humanitarian aid to Syria and they belonged to the Turkish intelligence agency MIT. The arrest of intelligence agency members by the gendarmerie led to a huge scandal. The prosecutor who ordered the search and all gendarmerie officials who took part were removed from their positions and many of them were charged with life imprisonment.<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt4\" id=\"ftnt_ref4\">[4]</a></sup></p><p>One year later, in May 2015, <em>Cumhuriyet</em> published an article and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://archive.is/clORH&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1497952921195000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF-wUDAKlXBpXXVQx7LRoZlX451fQ\">a video</a> on their website,<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt5\" id=\"ftnt_ref5\">[5]</a></sup> claiming that Turkish intelligence were helping to smuggle weapons to jihadist groups in Syria.The video shows security officers inspecting three trucks and uncovering missiles, mortars and anti-aircraft ammunition that were hidden underneath medical aid equipment. The media outlet claims that most of the ammunition was headed to ISIS and al-Qaeda and accused the government of committing a war crime.</p><p>After the publication of the article, government officials first claimed that the guns were headed to the “Free Syrian Army” opposition group, then denied the delivery altogether and shortly after Prime-Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu claimed “the humanitarian aid was going to our Turkmen brothers”.<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt6\" id=\"ftnt_ref6\">[6]</a></sup></p><p>On the day the article was published, a court in Adana issued an immediate gag order: all written, visual and online media outlets were banned from reporting or commenting on the scandal and all the content that had been published so far had to be removed under Law Nr. 3713, which is commonly referred as “Anti-Terror Law”.<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt7\" id=\"ftnt_ref7\">[7]</a></sup> Thus, by order of the judge, the newspaper had to completely delete the content from the website. Shortly after, Can Dündar and Erdem Gül were arrested with charges of espionage and treason. Even though they were released after four months, many of the newspaper’s top staff, writers and a reporter were still in prison, as of April 2017.</p><h2>How was the content blocked?</h2><p>Once a censorship attempt occurs, several legal and judicial tools are developed to monitor and censor media outlets across the country. Turkish courts and prosecutors have the right to issue gag orders and ask for the removal of all written and online content if deemed necessary, with national security discourse playing a huge role to legitimize the courts’ rulings, as in the case of the <em>Cumhuriyet</em>’s article. Provisions of criminal law, such as Anti-Terror Law, are applied to online content. Thus, court opinions on media censorship rely on “counter- terrorism, public interest, restoration of public order and prevention of crimes”.<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt8\" id=\"ftnt_ref8\">[8]</a></sup></p><p>Once a court issues the order, the Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) implements it in for broadcasting. Media outlets have to comply with the ban and they are forbidden to mention or comment on the forbidden content. RTÜK has the authority to sanction the broadcasters or even close the media outlets if they violate the orders.</p><p>For online material, the Telecommunication and Communication Presidency (TIB) was in charge of implementing the orders of prosecutors since 2007. Its jurisdiction is now transferred to the Information and Communication Technologies Authority (BTK) with the declaration of martial law after the July 2016 attempted coup. Under Law No.5651, commonly known as the “Internet Law”, banned content has to be removed within four hours once the court order is received by website owners. This law took effect in 2014 and expands TIB’s jurisdiction to allow blockage without prior court order, though it has to be confirmed by a court within 48 hours.<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt9\" id=\"ftnt_ref9\">[9]</a></sup></p><p>In this case, scholars estimate that government’s Internet authority TIB banned over 100,000 URLs and domains based on civil-code related complaints. Through TIB’s decisions Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram have been blocked multiple times with a single court order. If access to a single page cannot be blocked for technical reasons, the law allows the Internet service providers (ISPs) to block an entire domain.<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt10\" id=\"ftnt_ref10\">[10]</a></sup></p><p>ISPs also throttle Internet traffic (make Internet traffic slow), even if there is no legal ground for them to do so. However, researchers of Turkey Blocks, an independent group that monitors social media censorship, reveal that extrajudicial shutdown of social media applications and network throttling are employed right after terror attacks.<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt11\" id=\"ftnt_ref11\">[11]</a></sup> Access to Cumhuriyet has been throttled by TIB at least three times in last two years.<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt12\" id=\"ftnt_ref12\">[12]</a></sup> Furthermore, after the “MIT trucks” piece, another <em>Cumhuriyet</em> article, about  the financial activities of the Humanitarian Relief Foundation, an international NGO in relation to jihadist groups, was censored by court order and banned in Turkey.<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt13\" id=\"ftnt_ref13\">[13]</a></sup></p><h2>What’s next?</h2><p>It is almost a settled law now; at times of domestic crises, government resorts to censorship and throttle access to media platforms in Turkey. Despite legal and judicial constraints, journalists still seek digital tools to counter demands of content deletion. On the other hand, regular Internet users also try to find alternative ways to circumvent censorship and social media shutdowns through VPN. However, the government already ordered ISPs to block access to Tor and VPN services and leading service providers are implementing this order.<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt14\" id=\"ftnt_ref14\">[14]</a></sup></p><p>Many newspapers are even under the threat of losing their archives. 90-year-old Cumhuriyet is only one of them. In July 2016 only, 45 newspapers, three news agencies, 16 TV stations, 23 radio channels and 29 publishing houses were taken down on charges of producing propaganda for terror organizations<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt15\" id=\"ftnt_ref15\">[15]</a></sup> and the staff of some of the news organizations that were shut down claim that government-appointed trustees deleted the archives from the servers.<sup><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt16\" id=\"ftnt_ref16\">[16]</a></sup> There is no confirmation that this actually happened, but it is a fact that Internet users cannot reach the archives of many seized newspapers such as <em>Zaman</em> (once one of Turkey’s top-selling newspapers), its English-language sister publication Today’s <em>Zaman</em> and <em>Birgün</em>. </p><p>This method is particularly harsh and terrifying since the purpose of deleting an archive is not only the removal of an unwanted content, but also an attempt to wipe out the existence of the newspaper from history, as if it never existed.</p><hr /><div><p><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt_ref1\" id=\"ftnt1\">[1]</a> Twitter,<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://archive.is/1VcKL&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1497952921214000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFyvG1zYOZVlw2PAorK2u6e6Mi6sw\">Turkey,Transparency Report</a> 2017, (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://transparency.twitter.com/en/countries/tr.html)&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1497952921215000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGIoNk0N1oibyEw8F-MCMSX8F5bTg\">https://transparency.twitter.com/en/countries/tr.html) </a></p></div><div><p><a du-smooth-scroll href=\"#ftnt_ref2\" id=\"ftnt2\">[2]</a> Rima S.
